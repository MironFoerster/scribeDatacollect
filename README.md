# scribeDatacollect

This is an interactive web UI for generating two new word-level on-line Handwriting Datasets:
  one based on the existing IAM Handwriting database by allowing to split it into single words
  the other from scratch based on text data from https://www.kaggle.com/pariza/bbc-news-summary (News-Articles)
  
It is optimized for use on Tablets with a stylus.

Its purpose is to generate data, which can be used for training an AI-Model as described in Alex Graves Paper on sequence generation with LSTMs to generate handwritten words.
